                        <p>As a creative and <b>rigorous</b> designer with background as a developer, I regard user-centered
                            design, empathy, and creativity as my design philosophy. With a <b>deep understanding</b> of
                            technology and development.</p>
                        <p>
                            I believe it is <b>essential for a designer</b> to think about problems, outside the box, and
                            always
                            create user experience from a panoramic view.
                            Get familiar with the life-cycle of product development and explore the potential needs of
                            consumers through <b>multiple iterations.</b>
