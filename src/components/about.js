                        <h3>Tommy Jaks</h3>
                        <p>As a creative and rigorous designer with background as a developer, I regard user-centered
                            design, empathy, and creativity as my design philosophy.</p>
                        <p>
                            I believe it is essential for a designer to think about problems, outside the box, and always
                            create user experience from a panoramic view.
                            Get familiar with the life-cycle of product development, and explore the potential needs of
                            consumers through multiple iterations.
